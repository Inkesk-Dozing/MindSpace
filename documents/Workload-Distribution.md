# Workload Distribution for MindSpace Project

This document outlines the division of work among 6 team members for the MindSpace minor project. Each team member is assigned specific, measurable tasks to ensure clear responsibilities, individual contributions are visible for evaluation by the project checking committee, and both individual and group efforts can be rewarded with marks.

- **Evaluation Points:** Updated requirements file, integration logs, and deployment demo.

## [Team Member 6: Documentation and Quality Assurance]
- **Key Deliverables:** Comprehensive project documentation and QA report.
- **Measurable Contributions:**
  - Update and maintain `TODO.md` with progress tracking and task completion.
  - Create setup guides, user manuals, and code documentation.
  - Conduct code reviews and quality checks on all deliverables.
- **Evaluation Points:** Documentation files, QA checklist, and review reports.

### General Guidelines
- Each team member should maintain a personal log of contributions for committee review.
- Use version control to track individual commits, ensuring traceability of work.
- Schedule regular check-ins to align on dependencies and demonstrate progress.
- All tasks are designed to contribute to the group's overall goal while highlighting individual expertise.
